## General Information
- The dataset is made ready for linear regression
- Univariate and multivariate analysis done to find each independent variable significance and pair plots to see th ecorrelation between them.
- We are trying to find the number of rentals issued from the company based on numerous independent values such as temperature, weather, humidity, holiday, etc.
- The Boombikes bike rental dataset is being used.

## Conclusions
- The R-square can as 84.5% which is quite good for a model.
- There are many factors like temp, weather and days impacting the bike rentals in the US for boombikes.
- Differnt correlation found between pair of variables during hte analysis.
